## Subscription Engine

### Problem Statement:
 When it comes to online grocery items, like milk, eggs, bread, I always forget to buy it again until last minute. By the time, I remember, its too late and I do not have enough time to wait for online grocery to be delivered at my doorstep after a day or so,
 and I end up being in grocery store, thus, losing the point of online grocery.

### What we solve with this project:
 - We identify customer purchasing pattern. For example, customer buys Organic milk every 7th day, Horizon Eggs 5th day.
 - Once identified, the system tags the item to be a potential candidate for subscription.
 - Sends smart notification (using Twilio) to the customer to put the potential candidate to be a subscription item.
 - If customer accepts, types 'Yes' , subscription is added to customer account.

### Where can it be used :
 - Grocery items
 - Kids toys
 - Phamacy
